# AI-Powered Career Path Recommender

## üéØ Project Overview

This is an **AI-powered career recommendation system** developed as part of an internship project at **BrainWonders**. The application leverages advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze user profiles and provide personalized career guidance.

## üöÄ What This Application Does

The **Career Path Recommender** is an intelligent desktop application that:

- **Analyzes Personal Profiles**: Takes user input about interests, hobbies, strengths, and preferences
- **Provides AI-Driven Recommendations**: Uses multiple AI approaches to suggest the most suitable career paths
- **Offers Detailed Reasoning**: Explains why each career is recommended based on the user's profile
- **Covers 35+ Career Domains**: From traditional fields like Healthcare and Engineering to emerging areas like Cybersecurity and Data Science
- **Avoids Negative Matches**: Intelligently excludes careers that users explicitly mention they're not good at

## üß† Technical Architecture & Design Decisions

### Why This Approach Was Chosen

As an intern at BrainWonders, I developed this system using a **multi-tiered AI approach** to ensure robust and accurate career recommendations:

#### 1. **Cloud-Based LLM Integration**

- **Technology**: Hugging Face API with GPT-2 and other transformer models
- **Why Chosen**: Provides access to state-of-the-art language models without requiring local computational resources
- **Benefit**: More contextually aware recommendations with better natural language understanding
- **Implementation**: Handles authentication, fallback mechanisms, and error handling

#### 2. **Smart Rule-Based Analysis**

- **Technology**: Custom keyword matching with contextual sentiment analysis
- **Why Developed**: Ensures reliable fallback when cloud services are unavailable
- **Innovation**: Implements negative context detection to avoid recommending careers users explicitly mention they're not good at
- **Benefit**: Fast, reliable, and works offline

#### 3. **Local BART Model (Full Version Only)**

- **Technology**: Facebook's BART-large-MNLI for zero-shot classification
- **Why Selected**: Proven performance in text classification tasks, works completely offline
- **Trade-off**: Large model size (1.6GB) vs accuracy and offline capability

### Technical Implementation Highlights

#### **Intelligent Context Analysis**

```python
# Custom negative sentiment detection
negative_phrases = ['not good at', 'bad at', 'terrible at', 'not that good', 'struggle with']

# Context-aware keyword matching
keyword_pos = user_lower.find(keyword)
context = user_lower[max(0, keyword_pos-30):keyword_pos+30]
```

#### **Comprehensive Career Mapping**

- **35+ Career Domains**: Carefully selected to cover traditional and emerging fields
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Each career includes specific role examples and industry context
- **Keyword Optimization**: Extensive keyword mapping for accurate classification

#### **Multi-Level Confidence Scoring**

- **High Confidence**: 3+ relevant keyword matches
- **Medium Confidence**: 2+ relevant keyword matches
- **Low Confidence**: 1+ relevant keyword matches
